DOS attacks use any machine have a internet connection. Hackers hacked smart fridge, smart dishwasher and of course smart phone or laptop. After, hacker hadcked fridge or computer vs. All hacked machine send request
to target server.After, Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests
 from being fulfilled.It is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door or gate to a shop or business, and not letting legitimate parties enter into the shop or business, disrupting normal operations.
